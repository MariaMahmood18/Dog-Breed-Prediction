# Dog-Breed-prediction

This is a deep learning specifically transfer learning based Dog Breed Prediction Project.

## INTRODUCTION
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning, specifically deep learning, to identify 
various breeds of dogs based on images. The ability to distinguish between various dog 
breeds is not only a testament to the capabilities of machine learning but also holds practical 
applications in areas such as pet care and veterinary medicine.

## OBJECTIVE
The primary objective is to develop a deep learning model to accurately classify dog breeds 
from a dataset obtained from the Kaggle dog breed identification competition, comprising 
over 10,000 labeled images spanning 120 different breeds.

## SCOPE
Addressing the challenge of multi-class image classification for 120 different dog breeds, the 
project extends its reach into the realm of real-world applications, showcasing the versatility 
of machine learning.

## METHODOLOGY
Implementing a TensorFlow/Deep Learning workflow ensures a systematic approach to the 
project, covering data preparation, model selection, training, evaluation, and iterative 
improvements.

## TOOLS
The project will be implemented using the Python programming language, leveraging the 
TensorFlow framework, and executed in the Google Colab environment for its ease of use 
and access to GPU acceleration. 
TensorFlow 2.x serves as the backbone for both data preprocessing and model 
implementation. Deep learning is facilitated through pretrained deep learning models from 
TensorFlow Hub.

## METRICS
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, alongside visualization tools like TensorBoard, will be 
employed to assess and interpret the model's performance.
